She also collaborates closely with clinicians, research faculty, and site leadership to expand study operations to NYC H+H Elmhurst Hospital Center.

Nazly earned her M.A. in Clinical Psychology from Teachers College, Columbia University, where her research focused on barriers to mental health treatment and their relationship to acute suicide risk. She previously worked in the Suicide Prevention Research Lab at Mount Sinai, conducting clinical interviews with psychiatric inpatients following suicidal crises and contributing to manuscripts, conference presentations, and multi-timepoint data management. Her additional research experience includes culturally grounded youth mental health work through the CHamP Lab and community reintegration research with transitioning military service members through the Onward Ops program.

Nazly’s clinical background includes delivering Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy in Spanish to Latino adults with advanced cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering, as well as providing crisis intervention and advocacy for survivors of sexual and domestic violence at Columbia Health SVR and NYU Langone/Bellevue Hospital. Across her roles, she has developed strong competencies in crisis intervention, risk assessment, participant engagement, and culturally sensitive clinical care.

Nazly is highly interested in bilingual mental health interventions, suicide prevention, crisis response, and improving treatment access and engagement for underserved populations. She plans to pursue a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology, with goals of advancing research on acute suicide risk, culturally informed intervention development, and equitable mental health care delivery.
